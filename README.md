> Which cards have the longest names, you might wonder. Or which cards have the highest Power/Mana ratio? The answers to these questions and many more can be found in __magicalc__: The MTG calculator.

## Why?
__magicalc__ exists as an outlet for my newly found interest in [Magic: The Gathering](http://magic.wizards.com/) and ever growing interest in programming.


## Examples of calculations included
- Lands with most color identities
- Cards with the longest names
- Cards with the highest Power/Mana ratio

## Demo
Coming soon...

## Credits
__magicalc__ relies on the brilliant JSON dataset provided by [MTG JSON](http://mtgjson.com/).

## Development
Installs necessary dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

Runs TypeScript compiler, starts the server, launches the browser and watches for changes:
```
$ npm start
```

## TODO
- Create backend to cache dataset
- Implement testing framework
- Implement stylings
- Improve basic markup and create basic styling
